```
✅ migrations/0000_goofy_marvel_boy.sql    # Initial database schema
✅ migrations/meta/_journal.json           # Migration tracking
✅ migrations/meta/0000_snapshot.json      # Schema snapshot
✅ shared/schema.ts                        # TypeScript schema definitions
✅ drizzle.config.ts                       # Drizzle configuration
✅ .gitignore                             # Proper exclusion rules
```

### Database Features Implemented
- **ENUM Types**: role, test_type, test_status, request_status
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships with CASCADE rules
- **Indexes**: Automatic indexing on primary and foreign keys
- **Timestamps**: Created/updated tracking where needed
- **Constraints**: Data validation at database level

### Environment Variables Configured
